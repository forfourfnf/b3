:gf:awkward: I cannot believe that this is happening right now…
:dad:smug: I finally get to meet the one who stole my daughter’s heart. What an honor.
:bf:smug: Skap!
:dad:smug: Oh, that’s a language you don’t usually hear nowadays! Shaya, does he speak English? 
:gf:awkward: Yeah, but not the best. He’s South Korean, and he’s taught me a lot of the other language that he speaks. So I can understand him.
:dad:angry: Ooooh… teaching my daughter something valuable! At least you’ll be a bit helpful when you die tonight.
:gf:angry: DAD.
:dad:smug: Ok ok Shaya, I know you care for this boy. So just for you I’ll make a little deal. Your boyfriend and I will do a little musical battle in front of this crowd.
:dad:smug: If he wins, I’ll let him date you for the time being. If he loses, then I make him my rug. Deal?
:gf:reallysmug: Heh. You’ll regret that decision! Bartholomew is the best rapper AND singer I know! He’ll show you!
:bf:smug: Yeah!
:dad:angrysmile: Ha. Then let’s begin.
